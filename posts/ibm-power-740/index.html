<p>Turns out it was a top of the line box.</p>
<p>Specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 x 8 core Power7 @3.55GHz</li>
<li>384GB ram</li>
<li>4 x 146GB  15k SAS</li>
</ul>
<p>All CPUs and ram activated and has a PowerVM license.
Power consumption is not so good, it idles at around 360w-400w. I&rsquo;ll try pulling out some drives and PCIe cards that sit unused. It might take the consumption down by 20-40w.</p>
<h2 id="ibm-power-terminology">IBM Power terminology</h2>
<p>PowerVM - Hypervisor, like KVM or VMware on x86.</p>
<p>LPAR - Logical partition, what we would today call a VM.</p>
<p>Hardware Management Console - IBM appliance or VM that is used to manage virtualization of PowerVM</p>
<p>VIOS - Virtual IO Server, AIX instance that shares physical resources as virtual ones to other LPARs.</p>
<p>IBM Power7 servers always run a hypervisor, even when all resources are dedicated to one LPAR.</p>
<h2 id="uses-for-this-server">Uses for this server?</h2>
<p>Since getting AIX is hard, it might serve as a build server for Void Linux PPC BE packages, since the maintaner can&rsquo;t afford the time to continue. Not sure if I can, but I like the thought.</p>
